We know to-day matter compos atoms. but scienc young way greek appli idea profound. A liquid gas, said, consist round, smooth atoms, would cling together. then atom rough surfaces, "hooky" surfaces, stuck togeth form solids. the atom iron marble, instance, hooki that, got together, strong man could tear apart. the greek thought explan univers infinit number atom move mix infinit space infinit time, last hit chanc particular combin universe. thi simpl superficial. the idea atom cast aside, advanc variou ways. It famou manchest chemist, john dalton, restor earli year nineteenth century.

An atom smallest particl chemic element. No one ever seen atom. even wonder new microscop invent cannot possibl show us particl matter million time smaller breadth hair; size atoms. We weigh measur them, though invisible, know matter compos them. It new discoveri atom indivisible. they consist still smaller particles, shall see. but atom exist same, may still say brick materi univers built.

As rule, two atom first come togeth form larger particle, call "molecule." singl atom not, rule, exist apart atoms; molecul broken up, individu atom seek unit atom anoth kind amongst themselves. for example, three atom oxygen form call ozone; two atom hydrogen unit one atom oxygen form water. It molecul form mass matter; molecule, expressed, littl build atom bricks. In way get use first view materi thing handle. In liquid molecul liquid cling togeth loosely. they remain togeth body, roll away other. there "cohesion" them, less power solid. put water kettl light gas, present tini molecul water rush spout cloud steam scatter kitchen. the heat broken bond associ turn water someth like gas; though know particl come togeth again, cool, form drop water.

We need forc equal twenty-f ton tear asund molecul bar iron inch thick. yet structur "solid" popular sens word. If put piec solid gold littl pool mercury, gold take mercuri _between_ molecules, porou like sponge. the hardest solid like lattice-work usual mean "solid"; though molecul fixed, like bar lattice-work, violent motion; vibrat equilibrium positions. If could see right heart bit hardest steel, see billion separ molecules, distanc other, move rapidli fro. thi molecular movement can, measure, made visible.

As sir ernest rutherford, one greatest authorities, recent said, new physic dissip last doubt realiti atom molecules. the closer examin matter abl make show posit compos atoms. but must take word origin greek mean (an "indivisible" thing). the atom indivisible. they broken up. they compos still smaller particles. the discoveri atom compos smaller particl welcom realis dream haunt imagin nineteenth century. chemist said eighti differ kind atoms--differ kind matter--but one satisfi multiplicity. scienc alway aim simplic unity.

We seen spectroscop reveal vari natur light wave-lengths. light-wav set vibrat ether,[2] and, shall see, ether disturb kind; differ regard wave-lengths. the x-ray r\xf6ntgen discovered, then, light, varieti light previous unknown us; ether wave short length. x-ray prove great valu mani directions, world knows, need discuss point. let us see follow r\xf6ntgen\' discovery. [2] We refer throughout "ether" because, although modern theori dispens larg conception, theori physic inextric interwoven necessary, elementari exposition, assum existence. the modern view explain later articl einstein\' theory. while world wonder marvels, men scienc eagerli follow new clue mysteri matter exercis mind crook investigators. In 1896 becquerel brought us threshold great discovery. certain substanc phosphorescent--they becom lumin expos sunlight time, becquerel tri find substanc give rise x-rays. one day chose salt metal uranium.

It quickli recognised, moreover, tube radium (and metals) atom matter somehow break down. however, first step recognis three distinct differ ray given metal radium uranium. sir ernest rutherford christen them, first three letter greek alphabet, alpha, beta, gamma rays. We concern chiefli second group purpos deal group only.[3] [3] the "alpha rays" present recognis atom helium gas, shot rate 12,000 mile second. the "gamma rays" _waves_, like x-rays, materi particles. they appear type x-rays. they possess remark power penetr opaqu substances; pass foot solid iron, example. the "beta rays," first called, prove one interest discoveri scienc ever made. they prove crook surmis radiat discov vacuum tube. but _not_ fourth state matter found, new _property_ matter, properti common atom matter. the beta ray later christen electrons. they particl disembodi electricity, spontan liber atom matter: electron isol atom recognis first time separ entity. electrons, therefore, constitu atom matter, discov releas atom varieti agencies. electron found everywhere, form part everi atom. "an electron," sir william bragg says, "can maintain separ exist travel immens rate, one three-hundredth veloc light upwards, say, least 600 _mile second, thereabouts_. otherwis electron stick first atom meets." these amaz particl may travel enorm veloc 10,000 100,000 mile second. It first learn electr nature, bent normal path magnet brought near them. and fact led discovery: one sensat estim gener public apt believ found abstrus speculations. the physicist set littl chemic screen "beta rays" hit, arrang tube narrow sheaf ray pour screen. He drew sheaf ray cours magnet, accur measur shift lumin spot screen ray imping it. but know exact intens magnet field--which control likes--and amount deviat causes, mass move particles, tell speed move particl thu diverts. these particl hurl atom radium, neg pole vacuum tube, speed which, good conditions, reach nearli veloc light, i.e. nearli 186,000 mile second. their speed has, course, confirm number experiments; anoth seri experi enabl physicist determin size particles. onli one need described, give reader idea men scienc arriv startl results. fog, peopl know, thick great citi water-vapour gather particl dust smoke atmosphere. thi fact use basi beauti experiments. artifici fog creat littl glass tubes, introduc dust, variou proportions, supersatur vapour gather on.

In short, seri remark beauti experiments, check great laboratori world, settl natur so-cal rays. they stream particl thousand time smaller smallest known atom. the mass particl is, accord latest finest measur 1/1845 atom hydrogen. the physicist abl find charact except electr them, name "electrons" gener adopted. the key mani mysteri the electron atom, disembodi electricity; occupi exceedingli small volume, "mass" entir electrical. these electron key half mysteri matter. electron rapid motion, shall see, explain mean "electr current," long ago regard one mysteri manifest nature.

We know atom matter constantly--eith spontan stimulation--giv electrons, break electrons; therefor contain electrons. thu complet proof independ exist atom also electrons. when, however, man scienc tri tell us _how_ electron compos atoms, pass fact speculation, difficult speculation. take letter "o" print page. In littl bubbl hydrogen ga larger letter _trillions_ atoms; pack together, circul freeli dancer ball-room. We ask physicist take one minut atom tell us still smaller electron arrang it. natur make mental pictures, guess hypotheses, tri fit facts, discard _not_ fit. At present, nearli twenti year critic discussion, two chief theori structur atom. At first sir J. J. thomson imagin electron circul shell (like layer onion) round nucleu atom. thi suit, sir E. rutherford other work theori electron circul round nucleu rather like planet solar system revolv round central sun. Is nucleus, then, round electron revolve? the electron, saw, disembodi atom electricity; say, "negative" electricity. let us pictur electron move round orbit great velocity. now suggest nucleu "positive" electr attract pull revolv electron it, form equilibrium, otherwis electron would fli directions. thi nucleu recent name proton. We thu two electr atom: posit = nucleus; neg = electron. Of recent year dr. langmuir put theori electron _revolv round_ nucleus, remain state violent agit sort fix distanc nucleus.

It pretti gener accept atom matter consist number electrons, charg neg electricity, held togeth charg posit electricity. It disput electron state violent motion strain, therefor vast energi lock atom matter. To return later. here, rather, notic anoth remark discoveri help us understand natur matter. A brilliant young man scienc kill war, mr. moseley, year ago show that, atom differ substanc arrang order weight, _they also arrang order increas complex structure_. that say, heavier atom, electron contains. there gradual build atom contain electron lightest atom heaviest. here enough say took element element, lightest (hydrogen) heaviest (uranium) found strang regular relat them. If hydrogen repres figur one, helium two, lithium three, uranium, uranium figur ninety-two. thi make probabl natur ninety-two elements--w found eighty-seven--and number mr. moseley found number electron atom element; say, number arrang order atom number variou elements. \xa7 7 the new view matter Up point reached, then, see new view matter is. everi atom matter, whatev kind throughout whole universe, built electron conjunct nucleus. from smallest atom all--th atom hydrogen--which consist one electron, rotat round posit charg nucleus, heavi complic atom, atom gold, constitut mani electron complex nucleus, _we posit neg unit electricity_. the electron nucleu particl electricity. all matter, therefore, noth manifest electricity. the atom matter, saw, combin form molecules. atom molecul brick natur built everything; ourselves, earth, stars, whole universe. but brick requir build house. there fundament existences, variou form energy, give rise sever complex problems. and also remember, eighti distinct elements, definit type atom. We shall deal energi later. meanwhil remain said that, although discov great deal electron constitut matter, physicist day seem see possibl explain posit neg electricity, natur unknown. there exist theori particl posit neg electricity, make atom matter, point centr disturb kind univers ether, variou form energi are, fundament way, aspect primari entiti constitut matter itself. but discoveri properti radio-act rais mani interest questions, besid dealt with. In radio-act elements, uranium example, element break down; call radio-act manifest spontan chang elements. what realli take place transmut one element another, heavier lighter. the element uranium spontan becom radium, radium pass number stage it, turn, becom lead. each descend element lighter atom weight predecessor. the chang process, course, slow one. It may matter radio-active, made so. thi rais question whether matter univers may undergo disintegration. there is, however, anoth side question, discoveri radio-act brought light, effect revolut views. We seen radio-act substanc element break down. Is process build work? If complic atom break simpler forms, may convers process--a build simpler element complic elements? It probabl case process work. there eighty-odd chemic element earth to-day: outcom inorgan evolution, element give rise element, go back back primev stuff origin deriv infinit long ago? Is evolut inorgan world may go on, parallel evolut live things; organ evolut continu inorgan evolution? We seen evid inorgan evolut case stars. We cannot go deepli matter here, time come direct statement base find modern investigation. take altogeth evid steadili accumulating, author maintain alreadi evid inorgan evolut convinc enough. the heavier atom would appear behav though evolv lighter. the complex forms, supposed, _evolved_ simpler forms. moseley\' discovery, refer made, point conclus element built one another. \xa7 8 other new view We may refer anoth new concept discoveri radio-act given rise. lord kelvin, estim age earth twenti million years, reach estim consid earth bodi gradual cool down, "lose primit heat, like loaf taken oven, rate could calculated, heat radiat sun due contraction." uranium radio-act known kelvin, discoveri upset arguments. radio-act substances, perpetu give heat, introduc entir new factor. We cannot assum earth necessarili cool down; may even, know, get hotter. At 1921 meet british association, professor rayleigh state knowledg extend probabl period life globe one thousand million years, total age earth small multipl that. the earth, considers, cooling, "contain intern sourc heat disintegr uranium outer crust." On whole estim obtain would seem agreement geolog estimates. the question, course, cannot, present state knowledge, settl within fix limit meet gener agreement.

We saw electron shot atom speed may approach 160,000 mile second. sir oliv lodg written recent seventieth grain radium discharges, speed thousand time rifl bullet, thirti million electron second. professor Le bon calcul would take 1,340,000 barrel powder give bullet speed one electrons.

"i supposed," asks, "that fresh invention, discoveri made?" more one man scienc encourag us hope. here remark word written professor soddy, one highest author radio-act matter, chief scientif weekli (_nature_, novemb 6, 1919): the prospect success accomplish artifici transmut brighten almost daily. the ancient seem someth inkl accomplish transmut would confer upon men power hitherto prerog gods. but know definit materi aspect transmut would small import comparison control inexhaust store intern atom energi success accomplish would inevit lead. It becom problem, longer redol evil associ age alchemy, one big promis verit physic renaiss whole world. If "promise" ever realised, econom social face world transformed. befor pass consider ether, light, energy, let us see new light discoveri electron thrown natur manipul electricity. what IS electricity? the natur electr there least one manifest nature, late twenti year ago seem one mysteri manifest all, great measur explain new discoveries. already, begin century, spoke "age electricity," yet thing natur knew less. the "electr current" rang bells, drove trains, lit rooms, none knew current was. there vagu idea sort fluid flow along copper wire water flow pipe. We suppos _a rapid movement electron atom atom_ wire wherev current is. let us tri grasp principl new view electr see appli vari electr phenomena world us. As saw, nucleu atom matter consist posit electr hold togeth number electrons, charg neg electricity.[4] thi certainli tell us extent electr is, relat matter, leav us usual difficulti fundament realities. but know electricity, like matter, atom structure; charg electr made number small unit charg definite, constant amount. It suggest two kind electricity, i.e. posit negative, right-hand left-hand vortic whirlpool ether, ring ether, seriou difficulties, leav future. [4] the word "positive" "negative" electr belong day regard fluid. A bodi overcharg fluid call positive; undercharg bodi call negative. A positively-electrifi bodi one whose atom lost outli electrons, posit charg electr predominates. the negatively-electrifi bodi one normal number electrons. \xa7 10 what electr current the discoveri two kind electr has, however, enabl us understand fairli goe electr phenomena. the outli electrons, saw, may pass atom atom, this, larg scale, mean electr current.

So electron mere pass next atom, send electron third atom, on. In case, however, movement atom atom rapid rippl movement, may call so, may pass along enorm speed. We seen swiftli electron travel. but turn power enough even ring bell? the actual mechan apparatu energi electron current turn sound, heat, light describ technic section later work. We concern principle, clear. while zinc apt part electrons, copper oblig facilit passag onward. electron travel way metals, copper one best "conductors." So lengthen copper wire zinc carbon goe far front door bell, includ circuit. when press button door, two wire brought together, current electron rush round circuit; bell energi divert mechan apparatu ring bell. copper good conductor--six time good iron--and therefor common electr industries. some substanc stubborn copper yielding, call "insulators," resist current instead let flow. their atom easili part electrons. glass, vulcanite, porcelain good insul reason. what dynamo but even sever cell togeth produc current need modern industry, flow produc differ manner. As invis electron pass along wire produc call magnet field around wire, produc disturb surround ether. To exact, ether surround wire energi origin electron transmitted. To set electron move larg scale use "dynamo." By mean dynamo possibl transform mechan energi electr energy. the modern dynamo, professor soddi put it, may look upon electron pump.

[illustration: the caus OF tide the tide sea due pull moon, and, lesser degree, sun. the whole earth pull moon, loos mobil water free obey pull solid earth, although small tide also caus earth\' solid crust. the effect tide slow rotat earth explain text.] [illustration: _photo: G. brocklehurst._ the aegir ON the trent An except smooth format due perfect weather conditions. the wall-lik format tidal wave (see next page also) noticed. the reason downward current river head sea-wat back, thu help exagger advanc slope wave. the except spring tide caus combin oper moon sun, explain text.] [illustration: _photo: G. brocklehurst._ A big spring tide, the aegir ON the trent] the actual observ phenomena vastli complicated, complet theori bear littl resembl simpl form outlined. everyon live neighbourhood port knows, instance, high water seldom coincid time moon cross meridian. It may sever hour earli late. high water london bridge, instance, occur one half hour moon pass meridian, dublin high water occur one half hour moon cross meridian. the actual observ phenomena, then, far simple; have, nevertheless, complet work out, time high water everi port world prophesi consider time ahead. the action sun moon It would beyond scope attempt explain complet theory, may mention one obviou factor must taken account. sinc moon, gravit attraction, produc tides, expect sun, whose gravit attract much stronger, also produc tide and, would suppos first sight, power tide moon. but true sun produc tides, true power produc moon. the sun\' tide-produc power is, matter fact, less half moon. the reason _distance_ play enorm r\xf4le product tides. the mass sun 26,000,000 time moon; hand 386 time far moon. thi greater distanc counterbal greater mass, result, said, moon twice powerful. sometim sun moon act together, call spring tides; sometim act one another, neap tides. these effect complic number factors, tides, variou places, vari enormously. thu st. helena sea rise fall three feet, wherea bay fundi rise fall fifti feet. but here, again, reason complicated. \xa7 17 origin moon but anoth aspect tide vastli greater interest import theori discussing. In hand sir georg H. darwin, son charl darwin, tide made throw light evolut solar system. In particular, illustr origin develop system form earth moon. It quit certain that, long age ago, earth rotat immens faster now, moon near actual contact earth. In remot age moon point separ earth, thrown earth. earth moon one body, high rate rotat caus bodi split two pieces; one piec becam earth know, becam moon. such conclus led examin tides. In first place let us consid energi produc tides. We see evid energi round word\' coastlines. estuari scoop out, great rock gradual reduc rubble, innumer ton matter continu set movement. whenc energi derived? energy, like matter, cannot creat nothing; what, then, sourc make coloss expenditur possible. the earth slow the answer simple, startling. _the sourc tidal energi rotat earth._ the massiv bulk earth, turn everi twenty-four hour axis, like gigant flywheel. In virtu rotat possess enorm store energy. but even heaviest swiftest flywheel, work, even work friction bearings, cannot dispens energi ever. It must, gradually, slow down. there escap reasoning. It rotat earth suppli energi tides, and, consequence, tide must slow earth. the tide act kind brake earth\' rotation. these mass water, _held back moon_, exert kind drag effect rotat earth. doubtless effect, measur ordinari standards, small; is, however, continuous, cours million year dealt astronomy, small constant effect may produc consider results. but anoth effect shown necessari mathemat consequ tidal action. It moon\' action earth produc tides, also react moon. the tide slow earth, also drive moon farther farther away. thi result, strang may seem, permit doubt, result indubit dynam principle, cannot made clear without mathemat discussion. some interest consequ follow. sinc earth slow down, follow rotat faster. there period, long time ago, day compris twenti hours. go farther back still come day ten hours, until, inconceiv age ago, earth must rotat axi period three four hours. At point let us stop inquir happen moon. We seen present moon get farther farther away. It follows, therefore, day shorter moon nearer. As go farther back time find moon nearer nearer earth rotat faster faster. when reach period alreadi mentioned, period earth complet revolut three four hours, find moon near almost graze earth. thi fact remarkable. everybodi know _critic velocity_ rotat flywheel, veloc beyond flywheel would fli piec centrifug forc develop great overcom cohes molecul flywheel. We alreadi liken earth flywheel, trace histori back point rotat immens velocity. We also seen that, moment, moon bare separ earth. the conclus irresistible. In age remot earth _did_ fli pieces, one piec moon. such, brief outline, tidal theori origin earth-moon system. the day becom longer At beginning, moon split earth, obvious must share earth\' rotation. It flew round earth time earth rotated, say, month day equal length. As moon began get farther earth, month, moon took longer rotat round earth, began get correspondingli longer. the day also becam longer, earth slow down, take longer rotat axis, month increas greater rate day. present month becam equal two days, three, on. It calcul process went twenty-nin day month. after number day month began decreas reach present valu magnitude, continu decreas month day equal. In age earth rotat slowly. the brake action tide caus earth alway keep face moon; rotat axi time moon turn round earth. If noth earth moon involv state affair would final. but also effect solar tide considered. the moon make day equal month, sun tendency, still slow earth\' rotat axis, make day equal year. It would this, course, make earth take long turn axi go round sun. It cannot succeed this, owe action moon, succeed make day rather longer month. surpris may seem, alreadi illustr possibl satellit mars. the martian day one half-hour longer ours, two minut satellit mar discov notic inner one two revolv round mar seven hour forti minutes. In one martian day, therefore, one moon mar make three complet revolut round planet, that, inhabit mars, would three month day. bibliographi arrhenius, svante, _world making_. clerk-maxwell, james, _matter motion_. daniell, alfred, _A text-book principl physics_. darwin, sir G. h., _the tides_. holman, _matter, energy, forc work_. kapp, gisbert, _electricity_. kelvin, lord, _popular lectur addresses_. vol. i. _constitut matter._ lockyer, sir norman, _inorgan evolution_. lodge, sir oliver, _electrons_ _the ether space_. perrin, jean, _brownian movement molecular reality_. soddy, frederick, _matter energy_ _the interpret radium_. thompson, silvanu p., _light, visibl invisible_. thomson, sir J. j., _the corpuscular theori matter_. end project gutenberg ebook the outlin science, vol. 1 (of 4), J. arthur thomson *** end OF thi project gutenberg ebook outlin OF scienc *** ***** thi file name 20417-8.txt 20417-8.zip ***** thi associ file variou format found in: http://www.gutenberg.org/2/0/4/1/20417/ produc brian janes, leonard johnson onlin distribut proofread team http://www.pgdp.net updat edit replac previou one--th old edit renamed. creat work public domain print edit mean one own unit state copyright works, foundat (and you!) copi distribut unit state without permiss without pay copyright royalties. special rules, set forth gener term use part license, appli copi distribut project gutenberg-tm electron work protect project gutenberg-tm concept trademark. project gutenberg regist trademark, may use charg ebooks, unless receiv specif permission.
