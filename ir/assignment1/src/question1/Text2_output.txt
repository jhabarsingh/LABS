IS the sun dying? \xa7 3 now let us return consider sun. To us earth patent astonish fact sun tremend energy. heat light amaz quantiti pour without ceasing. where energi come from? enorm jet red glow gase seen shoot outward sun, like flame fire, thousand miles. doe argu fire, know fire earth? On point scientist sure. the sun burning, combust sourc heat. combust chemic reaction atoms. the condit make possibl known result predict measurable. but chemic reaction natur combust know explain sun\' energy, inde ordinari chemic reaction kind. If sun compos combust materi throughout condit combust understand alway present, sun would burn thousand years, mark chang heat light product process advanced. there evid changes. there is, instead, strong evid sun emit light heat prodigi quantities, thousands, million years. everi addit knowledg throw light sun\' age seem make increas rather decreas years. thi make wonder energi greater. and cannot avoid issu sourc energi say mere sun gradual radiat away energi origin unknown manner, away back begin things. reliabl calcul show year requir mere cool globe like sun could possibl run millions. In words, sun\' energi must subject continu less steadi renewal. howev may acquir enorm energi past, must sourc energi present. the best explan to-day continu accret energi due shrinkag sun\' bulk forc gravity. graviti one mysteri forc nature, obviou fact bodi behav attract one another, newton work law attraction. We may say, without tri go deepli things, everi particl matter attract everi throughout universe. If diamet sun shrink one mile round, would mean million ton outer one-mil thick would straight drop one mile toward centre. and all, obvious layer outer mile would also drop inwards, less degre one it. what tremend movement matter, howev slowli might take place! and tremend energi would involved! astronom calcul shrinkag one mile round would requir fifti year completion, assuming, reasonably, close continu relationship loss heat radiat shrinkage. even true need feel over-anxi theory; sun becam cold support life mani million year would required. It suggest one time fall meteor matter sun would account sun\' heat. thi posit hardli tenabl now. the mere bulk meteor matter requir hypothesis, apart reasons, it. there undoubtedli enorm amount meteor matter move within bound solar system, seem follow definit rout round sun like planets. the stray errat quantiti destin meet doom collis sun hardli suffici account sun\' heat. recent studi radio-act bodi suggest anoth factor may work power along forc gravit maintain sun\' store heat. In radio-act bodi certain atom seem undergo disintegration. these atom appear split minut primit constituents. but sinc matter may split constituents, may built them? the question whether "radio-active" element undergo disintegration, formation, sun. If undergo disintegration--and sun undoubtedli radio-active--then anoth sourc heat sun last indefinitely. the planet life IN other worlds? \xa7 1 It quit clear cannot life stars. noth solid even liquid exist furnac are. life exist planets, even possibl limited. whether stars, mani them, planetari famili like sun, cannot posit say. If have, planet would faint small visibl ten trillion mile away. some astronom think sun may except planets, reason specul unconvincing. probabl larg proport least star planets, may therefor survey globe solar system gener way extend result rest universe. In consid possibl life know may rule distant planet sun, uranu neptune. they probabl intrins hot. We may also pass nearest planet sun, mercury. We reason believ turn axi period revolv round sun, must therefor alway present side sun. thi mean heat sunlit side mercuri boiling-point, cold side must two three hundr degre freezing-point. the planet venu the planet venus, bright globe known morn even "star," seem first sight promis regard possibl life. It nearli size earth, good atmosphere, mani astronom believ that, like mercury, alway present face sun, would therefor disadvantage--a broil heat sunni side cold space opposit side. We sure. the surfac venu bright--th light sun reflect us dens mass cloud dust--that difficult trace perman mark it, thu ascertain long take rotat axis. mani astronom believ succeeded, planet alway turn face sun. If does, hardli conceiv life surface, spite cloud-screen.

Is life mars? the basi belief if, saw, globe solar system mass metal cool down, smaller cool larger, ahead development. now mar much smaller earth, must cool surfac million year earth did. hence, stori life began mar all, began long stori life earth. We cannot guess sort life-form would evolv differ world, confid say would tend toward increas intelligence; thu dispos look highli intellig be mars. but argument suppos condit life, name air water, found mars, disput whether found suffici quantity. the late professor perciv lowell, made lifelong studi mars, maintain hundr straight line drawn across surfac planet, claim bed veget mark site great channel pipe mean "martians" draw water polar ocean. professor W. H. pickering, anoth high authority, think line long, narrow marsh fed moist wind poles. there certainli white polar cap mars. they seem melt spring, dark fring round grow broader. other astronomers, however, say find trace water-vapour atmospher mars, think polar cap may simpli thin sheet hoar-frost frozen gas. they point that, atmospher mar certainli scanty, distanc sun great, may cold fluid water exist planet. If one ask wonder instrument cannot settl points, one must remind mar never nearer 34,000,000 mile earth, approach distanc fifteen seventeen years. the imag mar photograph neg taken big telescop small. astronom reli great extent eye, sensit photograph plate. but easi differ opinion eye sees, good deal controversy. In august, 1924, planet well place observation, may learn it. alreadi much-disput lines, peopl wrongli call "canals," trace photographs. astronom sceptic life mar often fulli awar extraordinari adapt life. there time climat whole earth, pole pole, semi-trop million years. No anim could endur least cold, yet plenti arctic plant animals. If cold came slowli mars, reason suppose, popul could gradual adapt it.
